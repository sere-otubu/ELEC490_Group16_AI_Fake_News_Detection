    "input": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and progressive pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, leading to hyperglycemia. Management begins with intensive lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and increased physical activity. Pharmacotherapy typically initiates with metformin, followed by individualized escalation using agents like GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, or insulin. Treatment goals extend beyond glycemic control to include cardiovascular and renal protection, reflecting the complex systemic impact of T2DM and emphasizing a holistic, patient-centered approach to care.",
    "output": "FACTUALLY ACCURATE.\n\nAnalysis: The text precisely defines Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, outlines the foundational role of lifestyle modifications, and details the standard progression of pharmacotherapy options, including the modern emphasis on cardiovascular and renal protection. This is fully consistent with contemporary endocrinology guidelines."
